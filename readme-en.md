## 📝 About

This repository brings together all the exercises and challenges I developed during the Logic Programming course at [Estudanauta](https://estudonauta.com).<br>
In it, in addition to understanding the most fundamental concepts of programming, I was able to develop in myself the logical, critical and resolute reasoning that every good programmer needs.
